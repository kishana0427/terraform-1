## To run ec2 module, boto3 package must be insttaled (pip install boto boto3 --user)

## A Playbook with Ansible EC2 & Ansible Vault – Secure Approach

To use the Ansible vault to securely store your AWS Keys,
You might need one more file on the same directory where you can save your credentials as variables and encrypt it with the vault.

The file can be imported later within the playbook.

Here is the modified playbook with a secure approach, Ansible Vault
---
- name: Create Ec2 instances
  hosts: localhost
  # import the secret file
  vars_files:
    - secrets.yml
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
  # Block is a Group of Tasks combined together
  - name: Get Info Block
    block: 
      - name: Get Running instance Info
        
        ec2_instance_info:
        register: ec2info 
      - name: Print info
        debug: var="ec2info.instances"
             
    # By specifying always on the tag, 
    # I let this block to run all the time by module_default
    # this is for security to not create ec2 instances accidentally
    tags: ['always', 'getinfoonly']
  - name: Create EC2 Block
    block: 
      - name: Launch ec2 instances
        tags: create_ec2
        ec2:
          region: us-east-1
          key_name: SaravAK-PrivateKey
          group: app_sec_group
          instance_type: t2.micro
          image: ami-2051294a
          wait: yes
          wait_timeout: 500
          count: 1
          instance_tags:
            name: appservers
            os: AmazonLinux
          monitoring: no
          vpc_subnet_id: subnet-3d3ef270
          assign_public_ip: yes
        register: ec2
        delegate_to: localhost
      - name : Add instance to host group
        add_host:
          hostname: "{{ item.public_ip }}"
          groupname: launched
        loop: "{{ ec2.instances }}"
      - name: Wait for SSH to come up
        local_action:
          module: wait_for
          host: "{{ item.public_ip }}"
          port: 22
          delay: 10
          timeout: 120
        loop: "{{ ec2.instances }}"
    # By specifying never on the tag of this block, 
    # I let this block to run only when explicitely being called
    tags: ['never', 'ec2-create']

 
# Saving the AWS Secrets

As we have included the secrets.yml file inside our playbook, Now we need to save our AWS KEY and SECRET

This is the content of the secret.yml file
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: AKIATQ7Q7SGKYB4TT3DX 
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: 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

It is saved as clear text info within the file so whoever opens it can see what is inside, so encrypt it using ansible-vault.
ansible-vault encrypt secrets.yml 
New Vault password: 
Confirm New Vault password: Encryption successful

# Now you have to remember this password and use it while you are starting the playbook.

For Ansible to ask you the password you should use a startup argument named --ask-vault-pass
ansible-playbook ec2-creation.yml \ 
--connection=local \ 
--tags=create_ec2 \ 
-e "ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/local/bin/python3" \ 
--ask-vault-pass

It would prompt you for the vault-password as it runs.
