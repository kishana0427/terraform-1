Taint needs: If a particular resource is not working as per expectation in real-time, we can recreate that resource using taint and then apply.

Taint: If we want a particular resource needes to be created in next run of 'terraform apply', we need to taint that resource.
Ex: terraform.exe taint google_compute_instance.my_vm_001

Untaint: If we want a particular resource needs to be untainted, we need to untaint that resource.
Ex: terraform.exe untaint google_compute_instance.my_vm_001
